## DFRWS 2017 Challenge Overview

The DFRWS 2017 challenge is about Internet of Things (IoT), defined generally to include network and Internet connected devices usually for the purpose of monitoring and automation tasks. Consumer-grade “Smart” devices are increasing in popularity and scope. These devices and the data they collect are potentially interesting for digital investigations, but also come with a number of new investigation challenges.

This challenge seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in IoT forensics by focusing the community’s attention on this emerging domain.

This challenge is made possible by a grant from the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT), N0002260.
