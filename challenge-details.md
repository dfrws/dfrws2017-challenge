# DFRWS 2017 Challenge Details

## SCENARIO

A woman (Betty) has been murdered. The murder was called in by Bettyâ€™s husband (Simon), who claims to have been at home at the time. Additional case details can be found here. Your job is to analyze these artifacts for forensically interesting information.

Time Zone: UTC+9

This Challenge aspires to motivate new approaches to forensic analysis and has four levels of participation:

1. Evaluating and Expressing Conclusions: Assigning the probability of the results given two competing propositions (e.g. The husband killed the wife, some unknown person did).
1. Device Level Analysis: Developing methods and tools to forensically process digital traces generated by IoT devices, including on mobile devices.
1. Network and Cloud Level Analysis: Developing methods and tools to forensically process digital traces generated by IoT devices on networks and cloud systems.
1. Correlation and Analysis: Developing methods and supporting tools that combine information from various data sources and automatically compute, visualize, or otherwise expose patterns of potential interest.
